Direct Digital Synthesis using Trinket Pro (ATmega328p)
=======================================================

This is sample code for the "Scope Noob" series on hackaday.com. Here I'm showing how to use an oscilloscope to measure signals generated using an R/2R ladder and a microcontroller.

Since the digital outputs are split between two different ports on the microcontroller you can measure the time between writing the outputs of one and the next.
